                I designed 2 versions of a plant shop website, and performed an A/B test on the two designs The goal is
                to measure which of the two designs is better at achieving a predefined task and goal. The task for
                users is to checkout their cart with at least $150 of cacti/succulents. The 2 metrics that were run on
                statistical tests were: Time to Completion and Return Rate.

                This is one of the projects from CS1300( an UIUX class at Brown). I first designed the tested websites
                with different design choices and formed statistical hypothesis. Then, I asked my friends to do the task
                to help me collect the data. I then extracted data from the Heroku logs, and transitioned the data to an
                excel sheet. Next, I cleaned and ran the data with scripts I developed in an earlier assignment. Lastly,
                I analyzed and interpreted the staistiscal results and analyzed it in further details.
                <em>I find this project to be a particularly interesting project because I learned to use data and
                    statistical analysis to gain deeper insights into the effectiveness of my own design choices.</em>

                <p>I added buttons that activate a pop up window beside eco-benefit numbers to help users
                    understand, use, and learn the app. The pop up window although not in the picture above explains
                    what the quantitative data means.

                20s, 20 people in their 30s-50s, and 5 people in their 50-60s. In the end, I had 23 people completed the
                task and were users who participated. Unfortunately, I do not know the background and demographic of
                people who actually completed the link. However, I gave a clear and standard instruction in text to
                everyone I reached out to. I asked them to check out $150 worth of items, and that is the only
                information I gave.

                I ran the Chi-squared Test from the python scripts I developed in an earlier class assignment to analyze
                time for a user to complete his or her $150 task. I defined the test, and explained my reasons for my
                alternative hypothesis below.

                            more readable for users to get information on what they want to buy. Users see the
                            description and price first which helps them do mental math to add things up to $150 so they
                            don’t have to return to the page.</p>

                            in the first go because they are likely to just click add, and return to the page if they
                            don’t meet $150.</p>

                            There is only 1 item per line, users need to scroll more. So, they don’t want to come back
                            to this page and do everything again. Therefore, they rather achieve $150 in one go, and not
                            return to the page after clicking checkout.</p>

                            scrolling is required. Less scrolling needed, and users will want to avoid doing mental
                            math. They expect to not meet $150 in the first go, and rather return to the page to add
                            more items.</p>

                , we can see 95% of the time, the true difference will be 0. My p-value of 0.06188
                is slightly larger than 0.05. So, I fail to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between design A
                and design B return rate. However this t-score is big, and therefore I think that there is likely a
                difference between the 2 design. However the restriction including sample size is not diverse enough
                that we still fail to reject the null hypothesis.

                I learned that my designs for interface A and interface B were not significant to Time to Completion &
                Return Rate think the result may have been related to reasons I listed in the previous section such as
                the sample is not large and diverse enough. However, through comparing individual user sessions, I see
                that users mostly had a shorter time to completion and lower return rate for design B which is what I
                initially thought.

                In general, this is one of my favourite projects in the class because I was taught to use data to gain
                insights into my design. Overall, I realized a more optimal layout, navigation, and affordability can
                save users’ time to meet their goal even though my project results were not significant. I look forward
                to use A/B testing in the future on my other projects.
