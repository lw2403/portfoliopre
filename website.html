                I redesigned the home page of a Japanese restaurant‚Äôs website which offers online ordering due to COVID.
                First, I identified different types of flaws in the original design and brainstormed solutions. Second,
                I created low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes. Third, I developed a
                responsive website from scratch based on my design.

                The sushi restaurant is one of many restaurants blocks away from my house. I personally know the

                during COVID as compared to some other restaurants.

                            First, the text and pictures are unaligned making it hard to read. Second, the picture loop
                            used to show recommended food is distracting and inefficient because users cannot compare
                            top selling items side by side. Additionally, the button states are unclear and confusing.
                            Users will think they have activated a button when they haven‚Äôt.

                    I decided to use red and brown as the website theme colour. In addition to creating the different
                    visual effects, I also recreated the logo to match with the rest of the styles.

                    I learned how to design a website that‚Äôs more user friendly and assessable. However, I had
                    challenges with choosing what style my redesigned website should be and developing the website to be
                    responsive. Overall, the project helped me practise html and css to turn designs into a responsive
                    website page. In terms of design, I intentionally added a banner image & slogan because I think
                    those are important for the home page of a restaurant website. I also simplified and reorganized the
                    food category because the original website is too distracting.
