                Iterative prototyping is an essential part of creating user interfaces. In this group project, my
                teammates and I designed an interface for a startup from scratch using only their concept. We did not
                use anything they’ve already built such as logo, images, or content. Afterwards, we iterated on our
                design based on feedback from classmates and an industry critic, and tested our final prototype on real
                users through usertesting.com.

                <em>“Lifestyle creators looking to monetize live content like yoga or cooking classes often have to
                    resort to multiple platforms. Reach.live aims to put all of them together: storefront, scheduling,

            <p class="wireframe-text">Each member of our group drew a set of sketches for at least three different
                pages: home page, event
                page, and analytics page. Our design for the event  page differed a lot. Member 4’s design only showed
                the categories of the event to the users when they landed on the event page, and the users would find
                out the information about the events after they clicked on the category they are interested in. Member
                1’s design showed the featured events of each category on the event page. In contrast, Member 3’s design
                only showed a list of the events of the default category (for example, fashion), and it would present
                the events in other categories after users clicked on the corresponding filters. Member 2’s designed the
                event page from the point of creators. Creators could edit event information and see attendees
                information on the page.</p>

            <p class="wireframe-text">Without logging in, users could only see the Home and Explore Events pages. They
                could only see the
                remaining pages of the website after logging in, as we believed this design choice would prompt more
                users to register for the site. This way, more users would be likely to become loyal to Reach.live as
                the company could then potentially reach out to them through email advertisements. Moreover, since the
                company is in its startup stage, we believed having more loyal users would be beneficial both in terms
                of scale and profitability.</p>

                    <p>The Home page contains several vertically stacked sections, each showcasing a different aspect of
                        the company. We all agreed that Reach.live is a platform for creators to both host and
                        participate in events, and strived to show this by displaying information relating to these two
                        aspects. These include sections of discover events, host events, monetize events, and live
                        interactions.</p>
                    <span>Explore Events Page</span>
                    <p>The Explore Events page shows a set of featured events under each category. We chose to present
                        all categories on one page without using any filter or tabs because this would make the page
                        look more straightforward and require fewer interactions, thus creating a more effortless
                        experience for first-time users.</p>

                    <p>There are two sections on the Events page: 1. Discover Events 2. My Events. In the Discover
                        Events section, users would see events in the default category, and they could view events of
                        other categories when they clicked on the corresponding tabs. We made this design choice instead
                        of showing events from different categories all together as we believed this would help users
                        discover the events that they want to attend more easily.</p>
                    <span>Analytics Page</span>
                    <p>The Analytics page contains a dashboard displaying a summary of important metrics, and several
                        charts displaying detailed breakdowns of each metric. We made this design decision because we
                        felt it was important for creators to gain insights into events they have hosted, and all of us
                        drew an individual analytics page in our sketches.</p>

                        usability reasons. The page requires content creators to input basic information such as what
                        the event is about, time of the event, and how much the event costs.</p>

                We first decided on a visual style that would attract the target audience of Reach.live by experimenting
                different colour palettes and visual elements. In the end, we decided to use orange as the theme colour
                because of its positive connotations and the vitality that it gives off to people. Additionally, we
                chose a curly font for titles to make it a more fun experience. Titles are in orange, subtitles are in
                dark blue, and texts are in black. The design choices we made are consistent for all the pages in the
                mockup. Below are some of the key features in the Hi-Fi mockup that we highlighted.

                During our studio, we received many suggestions that were especially helpful for our second iteration
                Hi-Fi Mockup design. After rounds of discussions on issues brought up in the studio, we made major
                design changes in our new mockup by adding the following features and elements.

                <span>ITERATION 2: Logout Button</span>
                <p>Studio Feedback:<em>Product does not provide an easy way to logout and switch accounts.</em></p>
                <p>Solution:<em>designed and added a link on the navigation bar right beside the “Welcome, Emily” to
                        provide users with an option to sign out if needed. Improves usability of the website, and
                        provides easy access for people to switch accounts.</em></p>

                <span>ITERATION 2: Event Filters</span>
                <p>Studio Feedback:<em>Users can’t easily filter events. Users in our studio also reflect that the time
                        in the day is also
                        very important when they make a decision on what events to attend.</em></p>
                <p>Solution:<em>Designed 3 filter options in the home page to help users quickly identify events that
                        are interesting to them (the type) at a time that they can attend (the date and time). We added
                        a filter and a drop down menu for users to select the dates and time that they are available to
                        register an event.</em></p>

                <p>Studio Feedback:<em>There was also suggestion on the sign-up function. In particular, one of our
                        peers said that the “plus” sign was a bit hard to notice and he wasn’t completely sure about
                        what that button would do.</em></p>
                <p>Solution:<em>Therefore, we changed all the “plus” signs to “sign up” buttons to make them stand out
                        so that they are more obvious to users.</em></p>

                        to the charts and pie graphs.</em></p>
                <p>Solution:<em>In the analytics page, we added an “Insight” section with the following 4 quick insights
                        that can help the creator to quickly reflect and make better content decisions. Insights
                        include: “Most Profitable Earning Component”, “Most Profitable Content Type”, “Major Follower

                        graphs
                        on our analytics page, our team made sure that there are enough colour contrasts in the pie

                pWe expected the users to be able to complete the sub-tasks easily without any confusion given our
                intentional design of clear menu options, minimum number of buttons and intuitive layout. The results
                from
                user testing aligned with our expectations and turned out to be very positive. One common thing they all
                mentioned was that the website is easy to navigate, simple, clear and well-put together. When watching
                their
                interactions with our site, we recognized that they all liked its modern and personal feel and
                appreciated
                its clear layout. The responses and comments from the three users are summarized below.

                In general, the users not only found all four tasks easy to complete, but were also confident that they
                had completed the tasks successfully. The durations of time they spent on each task were very similar
                and no one seemed to struggle with a particular task. Though none of the users made an error, there were
                few moments when some users felt slightly unsure about their actions.

            <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
            <span>Execute the final user interface and branding</span>
            <p>This project was an invaluable opportunity for us to practice the entire iterative design process, from
                ideation, wire framing, prototyping, to evaluation. By merging everyone’s differing sketches and making
                improvements based on critiques from classmates and industry experts, we learned various good practices
                of designing a clear, intuitive interface such as the importance of a coherent visual identity and clear
                navigation. Moreover, based on the user’s performance and feedback, we would like to make the following
                improvements to our interface in the future.</p>
