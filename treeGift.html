                Trella Tree Gift is an online tree gifting app designed for virtual tree buying, gifting, and planting
                experience. It targets people who are environmentally cautious and want to plant trees for social good
                together with their friends. Through efforts to conduct user interviews, gain expertise advice, and

                users of American Forest and Treedom. However both of the websites mentioned does not offer additional
                user experience that helps the users to influence their friends to also join so it’s a double ended

                    <p>The Home page contains several vertically stacked sections, each showcasing a different aspect of
                        the company. We all agreed that Reach.live is a platform for creators to both host and
                        participate in events, and strived to show this by displaying information relating to these two
                        aspects. These include sections of discover events, host events, monetize events, and live
                        interactions.</p>
                    <span>Explore Events Page</span>
                    <p>The Explore Events page shows a set of featured events under each category. We chose to present
                        all categories on one page without using any filter or tabs because this would make the page
                        look more straightforward and require fewer interactions, thus creating a more effortless
                        experience for first-time users.</p>

                    <p>There are two sections on the Events page: 1. Discover Events 2. My Events. In the Discover
                        Events section, users would see events in the default category, and they could view events of
                        other categories when they clicked on the corresponding tabs. We made this design choice instead
                        of showing events from different categories all together as we believed this would help users
                        discover the events that they want to attend more easily.</p>
                    <span>Analytics Page</span>
                    <p>The Analytics page contains a dashboard displaying a summary of important metrics, and several
                        charts displaying detailed breakdowns of each metric. We made this design decision because we
                        felt it was important for creators to gain insights into events they have hosted, and all of us
                        drew an individual analytics page in our sketches.</p>

                After the prototype has been developed, my team decided to do a round of user testing before developing
                the app. I personally scheduled user testing sessions with 5 friends of Trella and sent over 100+
                surveys out. Below are some feedbacks collected based on my solution.

                        life and the app experience. In the future, we will also include game features such as watering

                user testing aligned with our expectations and turned out to be very positive. One common thing they all
                mentioned was that the website is easy to navigate, simple, clear and well-put together. When watching
                their
                interactions with our site, we recognized that they all liked its modern and personal feel and
                appreciated
                its clear layout. The responses and comments from the three users are summarized below.

                had completed the tasks successfully. The durations of time they spent on each task were very similar
                and no one seemed to struggle with a particular task. Though none of the users made an error, there were
                few moments when some users felt slightly unsure about their actions.

            <p>This project was an invaluable opportunity for us to practice the entire iterative design process, from
                ideation, wireframing, prototyping, to evaluation. By merging everyone’s differing sketches and making
                improvements based on critiques from classmates and industry experts, we learned various good practices
                of designing a clear, intuitive interface such as the importance of a coherent visual identity and clear
                navigation. Moreover, based on the user’s performance and feedback, we would like to make the following
                improvements to our interface in the future.</p>
